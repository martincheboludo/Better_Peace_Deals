Limited Victory scenario LOSER gets this event from the WINNER and can accept or decline
---------------------------

For the Limited Victory scenario, where the loser only hands over cores and claims but not all occupied states, the acceptance or decline modifiers will be adjusted to reflect the less severe nature of the peace deal compared to Total Victory. Here’s how you might set up the modifiers:

Revised Limited Victory Scenario (Loser’s Perspective)
1. Surrender Percentage:

0-10%: +50% to Decline

10-20%: +40% to Decline

20-30%: +30% to Decline

30-40%: +20% to Decline

40-50%: Neutral (0%)

50-60%: +10% to Acceptance

60-70%: +20% to Acceptance

70-80%: +30% to Acceptance

80-90%: +40% to Acceptance

90-100%: +50% to Acceptance

Rationale: Very low surrender percentages indicate strong resistance, making acceptance less likely. As surrender percentage increases, acceptance becomes more feasible.

2. Stability Percentage:

0-10%: +40% to Acceptance

10-20%: +30% to Acceptance

20-30%: +20% to Acceptance

30-40%: +10% to Acceptance

40-50%: Neutral (0%)

50-60%: +10% to Decline

60-70%: +20% to Decline

70-80%: +30% to Decline

80-90%: +40% to Decline

90-100%: +50% to Decline

Rationale: Stability affects the likelihood of acceptance, with lower stability making acceptance more likely.

3. War Support Percentage:

60-70%: +20% to Decline

70-80%: +30% to Decline

80-90%: +40% to Decline

90-100%: +50% to Decline

Rationale: Lower war support increases acceptance, but less so compared to more severe deals.

4. Presence of a Strong Ally:

No strong allies: +10% to Acceptance

Strong ally present: +10% to Decline

Rationale: The presence of a strong ally still affects the decision, though less dramatically for a less severe peace deal.

5. Strength Ratio of Army:

Enemy Strength is More Than Three Times Yours: +30% to Acceptance

Enemy Strength is Two to Three Times Yours: +20% to Acceptance

Enemy Strength is Equal to or Slightly Greater Than Yours: +10% to Acceptance

Your Strength is Equal to or Slightly Greater Than the Enemy’s: +10% to Decline

Your Strength is More Than Two Times the Enemy’s: +20% to Decline

Rationale: Lower manpower increases acceptance likelihood, but this effect is less pronounced compared to more severe scenarios.

7. Manpower Law:

Disarmed Nation: +40% to Acceptance

Volunteer Only: +30% to Acceptance

Limited Conscription: +20% to Acceptance

Extensive Conscription: +10% to Acceptance

Service by Requirement: Neutral (0%)

All Adults Serve: +10% to Decline

Scraping the Barrel: +20% to Decline

Rationale: Manpower laws affect acceptance, with more severe laws making decline more likely.

8. Economy Law:

--------------------
Status Quo Ante Bellum Scenario ANY ONE OF THE TWO CAN SEND IT TO EACH OTHER
--------------------

For the Status Quo Ante Bellum scenario, where the peace deal involves a white peace with no territorial changes, the acceptance or decline will likely be influenced by the less severe nature of the deal. Here’s how the modifiers might look from the loser’s perspective:


1. Surrender Percentage:

0-10%: +50% to Acceptance

10-20%: +40% to Acceptance

20-30%: +30% to Acceptance

30-40%: +20% to Acceptance

40-50%: +10% to Acceptance

50-60%: Neutral (0%)

60-70%: +10% to Decline

70-80%: +20% to Decline

80-90%: +30% to Decline

90-100%: +40% to Decline

Rationale: Given the non-punitive nature of a white peace, lower surrender percentages are more likely to favor acceptance.

2. Stability Percentage:

0-10%: +40% to Acceptance

10-20%: +30% to Acceptance

20-30%: +20% to Acceptance

30-40%: +10% to Acceptance

40-50%: Neutral (0%)

50-60%: +10% to Decline

60-70%: +20% to Decline

70-80%: +30% to Decline

80-90%: +40% to Decline

90-100%: +50% to Decline

Rationale: Stability affects the decision, but since the terms are neutral, higher stability might make acceptance less favorable as they might want to continue.

3. War Support Percentage:

0-10%: +40% to Acceptance

10-20%: +30% to Acceptance

20-30%: +20% to Acceptance

30-40%: +10% to Acceptance

40-50%: Neutral (0%)

50-60%: +10% to Decline

60-70%: +20% to Decline

70-80%: +30% to Decline

80-90%: +40% to Decline

90-100%: +50% to Decline

Rationale: Lower war support typically increases acceptance, but for a white peace, higher war support can push towards a desire to continue the conflict.

4. Presence of a Strong Ally:

No strong allies: +20% to Acceptance

Strong ally present: +20% to Decline

Rationale: Having no strong allies might make acceptance more favorable, but the presence of an ally could lead to a stronger push to continue.

5. Strength Ratio of Army:

Enemy Strength is More Than Three Times Yours: +30% to Acceptance

Enemy Strength is Two to Three Times Yours: +20% to Acceptance

Enemy Strength is Equal to or Slightly Greater Than Yours: +10% to Acceptance

Your Strength is Equal to or Slightly Greater Than the Enemy’s: +10% to Decline

Your Strength is More Than Two Times the Enemy’s: +20% to Decline

Your Strength is More Than Three Times the Enemy’s: +30% to Decline

Rationale: If the enemy is significantly stronger, acceptance is more likely, but if the strength is more balanced, the decision could lean towards decline.

6. Manpower:

0 Manpower: +40% to Acceptance

1,000 to 10,000 Manpower: +30% to Acceptance

10,000 to 50,000 Manpower: +20% to Acceptance

50,000 to 100,000 Manpower: +10% to Acceptance

100,000 to 250,000 Manpower: Neutral (0%)

250,000 to 500,000 Manpower: +10% to Decline

500,000 to 1,000,000 Manpower: +20% to Decline

1,000,000 to 2,000,000 Manpower: +30% to Decline

More Than 2,000,000 Manpower: +40% to Decline

Rationale: Very low manpower makes acceptance more likely, as the country might prefer to avoid further conflict.

7. Manpower Law:

Disarmed Nation: +30% to Acceptance

Volunteer Only: +20% to Acceptance

Limited Conscription: +10% to Acceptance

Extensive Conscription: Neutral (0%)

Service by Requirement: Neutral (0%)

All Adults Serve: +10% to Decline

Scraping the Barrel: +20% to Decline

Rationale: The impact of manpower laws influences the decision, with more severe laws making it slightly more likely to accept.

8. Economy Law:

Civilian Economy: +30% to Acceptance

Early Mobilization: +20% to Acceptance

Partial Mobilization: +10% to Acceptance

War Economy: Neutral (0%)

Total Mobilization: +10% to Decline

Rationale: The economy’s impact on acceptance for a white peace is moderate, with higher mobilization laws potentially pushing towards a desire to continue the fight.

This setup should reflect the nature of the Status Quo Ante Bellum scenario and how various factors could influence the decision to accept or decline the peace offer.

-----------------------
Total Surrender Scenario LOSER SENDS TO WINNER, WINNER CAN ACCEPT OR DECLINE
------------------------

Total Surrender Scenario (Winner’s Perspective)
In the Total Surrender scenario, the loser offers everything including occupied states, cores, and claims in exchange for peace. This is the most severe form of surrender for the loser. From the winner's perspective, accepting this deal or not will be influenced by various factors, with the emphasis on how likely they are to achieve a better outcome by continuing the war versus accepting the comprehensive surrender offer.

Surrender Percentage of the Loser:

0-10%: +50% to Acceptance
10-20%: +40% to Acceptance
20-30%: +30% to Acceptance
30-40%: +20% to Acceptance
40-50%: +10% to Acceptance
50-60%: Neutral (0%)
60-70%: +10% to Decline
70-80%: +20% to Decline
80-90%: +30% to Decline
90-100%: +40% to Decline
Rationale: If the loser is far from surrendering, the winner may prefer to push for a complete victory, making them less likely to accept the offer. If the surrender progress is high, the deal becomes more attractive as it secures a significant win with minimal additional effort.

Stability Percentage of the Winner:

0-10%: +50% to Acceptance
10-20%: +40% to Acceptance
20-30%: +30% to Acceptance
30-40%: +20% to Acceptance
40-50%: +10% to Acceptance
50-60%: Neutral (0%)
60-70%: +10% to Decline
70-80%: +20% to Decline
80-90%: +30% to Decline
90-100%: +40% to Decline
Rationale: High stability might encourage the winner to continue the war, decreasing the likelihood of accepting the offer. Conversely, low stability could make accepting the offer more attractive as it could end the conflict and stabilize the situation.

War Support Percentage of the Winner:

0-10%: +50% to Acceptance
10-20%: +40% to Acceptance
20-30%: +30% to Acceptance
30-40%: +20% to Acceptance
40-50%: +10% to Acceptance
50-60%: Neutral (0%)
60-70%: +10% to Decline
70-80%: +20% to Decline
80-90%: +30% to Decline
90-100%: +40% to Decline
Rationale: Low war support might increase the winner's willingness to accept a total surrender offer as it would end the conflict. High war support may make them prefer to continue fighting.

Presence of Strong Allies for the Winner:

No strong allies: +30% to Acceptance
Strong ally present: +10% to Decline
Rationale: If the winner lacks strong allies, they might be more inclined to accept a total surrender to secure a significant win and end the war. Strong allies might provide the necessary support to continue the conflict.

Strength Ratio of Army (Winner’s Perspective):

Enemy Strength is More Than Three Times Yours: +40% to Acceptance
Enemy Strength is Two to Three Times Yours: +30% to Acceptance
Enemy Strength is Equal to or Slightly Greater Than Yours: +20% to Acceptance
Your Strength is Equal to or Slightly Greater Than the Enemy’s: +10% to Acceptance
Your Strength is More Than Two Times the Enemy’s: +10% to Decline
Your Strength is More Than Three Times the Enemy’s: +20% to Decline
Rationale: If the winner has significantly greater strength, they might find the total surrender offer attractive as it secures a complete victory. If they are relatively strong compared to the enemy, they might prefer to push for further gains.

Remaining Manpower of the Winner:

0 Manpower: +50% to Acceptance
1,000 to 10,000 Manpower: +40% to Acceptance
10,000 to 50,000 Manpower: +30% to Acceptance

Limited Conscription: +30% to Acceptance
Extensive Conscription: +20% to Acceptance
Service by Requirement: +10% to Acceptance
All Adults Serve: Neutral (0%)
Scraping the Barrel: -10% to Decline
Rationale: If the winner has more restrictive manpower laws, they might be more inclined to accept a total surrender to avoid further resource strain. More relaxed laws could make them more willing to continue the fight.

Economy Law of the Winner:

Civilian Economy: +50% to Acceptance
Early Mobilization: +40% to Acceptance
Partial Mobilization: +30% to Acceptance
War Economy: +20% to Acceptance
Total Mobilization: Neutral (0%)

-------------------------
