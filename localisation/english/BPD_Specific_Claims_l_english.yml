BPD_Specific_Claims_Country.1.d:0 "The region of the Horn of Africa represents a vital strategic opportunity for the growth and prosperity of the Italian Empire. Ethiopia, with its vast natural resources and prime location along critical trade routes, is a key piece in expanding our influence across East Africa. By securing Ethiopia, we will not only solidify Italy's rightful claim to the region but also enhance our access to valuable materials needed to fuel our industry and military might. This conquest will restore Italy's prestige on the global stage, asserting our dominance over lesser powers and fulfilling our vision of a new Roman Empire in Africa. The acquisition of Ethiopia will also provide us with a vital staging ground for future territorial expansions, cementing Italy's rightful place as a colonial power alongside our European counterparts."

BPD_Specific_Claims_Country.2.d:0 "With Greece under Axis control, the time has come to decide the fate of its territories. As the dominant power in the Axis, Germany must determine how to divide Greece between our allies while securing our own strategic interests in the region.\n\nWe are presented with two distinct options:\n\n§RHistorical Division§!:\nFollowing historical agreements, Greece will be divided between Germany, Bulgaria, and Italy. Germany will claim a portion of Thrace, securing a foothold in the Balkans, as well as part of Crete for strategic control of the Mediterranean. Bulgaria will be awarded the remainder of Thrace, while Italy will take control of the rest of Greece, solidifying its influence in the region.\n\n§RDivide Between Bulgaria and Italy§!:\nIn this option, Germany will abstain from claiming Greek territories, allowing our allies to strengthen their hold. Bulgaria will gain control of all of Thrace, while Italy will assume control over the remainder of Greece. While Germany forfeits direct territorial gains, this division ensures stability in the Balkans and reinforces the Axis alliance, allowing Germany to focus its efforts on other fronts."

As the leader of the Axis, we can dictate the division of Yugoslavia among our allies, ensuring Germany retains key strategic territories while maintaining control over the region.\n\nWe are presented with three distinct options:\n\n§RHistorical Claims Only§!:\nIn accordance with previous agreements, Yugoslavia will be divided among our Axis partners. Germany will secure Slovenia, Hungary will claim Vojvodina, Bulgaria will take control of Macedonia and Southern Serbia, while Italy will expand its influence with the acquisition of Ljubljana, Montenegro, and Kosovo. Croatia and Serbia will become puppet states, serving as vital buffers under German supervision.\n\n§RItaly Gets Dalmatia§!:\nIn this option, Italy will be granted additional territories along the Dalmatian coast, furthering their power in the Adriatic. While Germany retains Slovenia and influence over the Yugoslav heartland, this arrangement strengthens Italy’s position but ensures our interests remain secure."

BPD_Specific_Claims_Country.4.d:0 "Bulgaria represents a key opportunity for the expansion of the Italian Empire into the Balkans. With its strategic position in Southeastern Europe, controlling Bulgaria would provide Italy with vital access to the Black Sea and key transportation routes to further our ambitions in the region. Bulgaria’s resources and manpower would strengthen our military capabilities and support our wider vision of uniting the Balkans under Italian influence. Furthermore, bringing Bulgaria under Italian control would limit the influence of both Germany and the Soviet Union, positioning Italy as the dominant power in the Balkans and reinforcing our path toward restoring the glory of the Roman Empire. This claim is essential in cementing Italy’s dominance over its Balkan neighbors and expanding our sphere of influence."

BPD_Specific_Claims_Country.5.d:0 "Turkey occupies a critical geopolitical position, bridging Europe and Asia, and controlling access to the Mediterranean and the Middle East. Securing control over Turkey would allow the Italian Empire to dominate the Bosporus and Dardanelles, crucial choke points for trade and military operations. Turkey's natural resources, combined with its strategic location, would bolster Italy’s economic and military strength, enabling us to project power deep into the Eastern Mediterranean and beyond. By asserting our claim on Turkey, Italy will not only limit the influence of rival powers such as the Soviet Union and Britain but also gain a powerful foothold in a region of immense historical and strategic significance. The conquest of Turkey would reaffirm Italy's imperial ambitions and mark a crucial step toward the revival of the Roman Empire."

By asserting our claim over Greece, Italy would secure vital ports and control key trade routes, enhancing our dominance over the Mediterranean. Furthermore, Greece’s natural resources and manpower would contribute to Italy’s war effort and economic expansion, ensuring our position as a formidable power in the region.

With its abundant resources and control over important transportation routes, Yugoslavia is a key piece in our plan to extend Italian hegemony over the Balkans. By asserting our claim on Yugoslavia, Italy will limit the influence of other regional powers while consolidating our position as the dominant force in Southeastern Europe. This is a crucial step toward the revival of the Roman Empire and Italy’s rightful place as a European power."

Both territories hold immense historical and strategic significance, with Corsica offering control over Mediterranean routes and Savoy providing a buffer between Italy and France.\n\n§RClaim Previous Plus Alpes and Rhône§!:\nThis option goes further, allowing Italy to expand beyond Corsica and Savoy to claim the Alpine regions and the Rhône valley. By securing these additional territories, Italy will strengthen its control over critical mountain passes and river systems, enhancing both our defensive and economic position in Western Europe."

Securing Tunisia will enhance our control over the Mediterranean and provide valuable resources to fuel our empire.\n\n§RModerate Claims§!:\nBuilding on the Minimalist Claims, this option expands our reach to include Malta, Cyprus, and Egypt, in addition to Tunisia. By claiming these territories, Italy will gain control over crucial islands and the vital Nile Valley, strengthening our strategic positioning in the Mediterranean and the Red Sea, and enhancing our trade routes and military presence in the region.\n\n§RMaximalist Claims§!:\nThis most ambitious option includes all the territories from the Moderate Claims, plus the Arabian Peninsula. By asserting control over Tunisia, Malta, Cyprus, Egypt, and the Arabian Peninsula, Italy will extend its influence across a vast region, securing crucial territories in both North Africa and the Middle East. This sweeping control will significantly bolster our strategic and economic dominance, positioning Italy as a major power in the colonial world."

The strategic importance of this region is undeniable, but we must carefully consider the implications of our decisions on our post-war relations and long-term stability. It is important to note that this decision will not affect any existing cores or claims we have on France, which will be retained regardless of the choice made.\n\nWe are presented with two options:\n\n§ROccupy it indefinitely§!:\nBy choosing to occupy Northern France indefinitely, we secure continued control over a strategically vital area. This would provide us with economic and military advantages but could also lead to friction with Vichy France. Maintaining this territory may create resentment and the potential for future hostility, transforming Vichy France from a collaborative partner into a potential enemy.\n\n§RReturn it at the end of the war§!:\nOpting to return Northern France at the end of the war could foster goodwill and maintain a cooperative relationship with Vichy France. This approach would help stabilize the region and potentially prevent future conflicts. By choosing this path, we avoid the risk of creating a lasting adversary and ensure a more stable post-war environment.

By focusing on the 1914 borders, we restore historical claims and consolidate control over key areas while maintaining a more restrained approach to territorial expansion.\n\n§RPrevious Plus Lodz and Plock§!:\nBuilding on the 1914 borders, this option includes the addition of Lodz and Plock. By claiming these additional cities, we enhance our strategic and economic position in Poland, gaining control over vital industrial and logistical centers that will further bolster our influence in the region.\n\n§RAll of Poland§!:\nThe most expansive option, this claim encompasses all of Poland. By asserting control over the entire country, we consolidate complete dominance over Polish territory, ensuring total control over its resources, infrastructure, and strategic position. This approach maximizes our territorial gains and influence but requires careful consideration of the potential political and military repercussions."

By restoring control over Alsace, we reinforce our western defenses and regain a key part of our national heritage.\n\n§RAlsace and Nord Pas du Calais§!:\nBuilding on the claim to Alsace, this option extends German control to Nord Pas du Calais, a region vital for its industrial strength and strategic position near the English Channel. Securing both Alsace and Nord Pas du Calais strengthens our position in Western Europe and enhances our economic and military capabilities.\n\n§RPrevious Plus Eastern France (HRE Border)§!:\nThe most expansive claim, this option seeks to extend our control to the historical borders of the Holy Roman Empire, encompassing Eastern France. By pushing the border to include all territories that once lay within the HRE, we cement Germany's dominance in the region and reclaim historical lands that have long been contested.

By promising to return control of Western Europe, we avoid long-term conflicts and potential resistance from local populations, while still securing our core objectives during the war.\n\n§RGerman Speaking Areas Only§!:\nIn this option, we seek to annex German-speaking areas within Western Europe, including Austria, the Sudetenland, and Alsace-Lorraine. This claim reinforces our ethnic and cultural ties to these regions, ensuring that all German-speaking peoples are united under the Reich without overextending our resources.\n\n§RPrevious Plus Benelux and Czechia§!:\nExpanding our ambitions, this option includes the annexation of the Benelux countries (Belgium, the Netherlands, and Luxembourg), along with all of Czechia (Sudetenland, Bohemia, and Moravia) and the German-speaking territories. This would provide us with strategic control over critical European trade routes and military positions, ensuring a stronger economic and political foothold in Central and Western Europe.\n\n§RPrevious Plus Norway and Denmark§!:\nThe most expansive option extends our control to include Norway and Denmark, alongside the Benelux, Czechia, and German-speaking areas.

By focusing our resources on the continent, we ensure the consolidation of our power in Europe, foregoing colonial ambitions for the time being to avoid overstretching our capabilities and potential conflicts with other colonial powers.\n\n§RReturn of German Colonies§!:\nThis option seeks the restoration of the colonial territories Germany lost after the Great War, including Togoland, German East Africa, and German South-West Africa. Reclaiming these colonies would bolster our economy with access to valuable resources and markets while reasserting Germany’s rightful place as a colonial power.\n\n§RPrevious Plus Mittelafrika§!:\nThe most ambitious plan would see Germany not only reclaim its lost colonies but also expand its control over the concept of Mittelafrika—a vast colonial empire in central Africa.

The German-speaking areas of Switzerland will come under our control, while Italy will claim the Italian-speaking regions, such as Ticino. This will secure our influence in the Alpine region and strengthen our ties with our Axis partners.\n\n§RPartition With Italy and France§!:\nThis more comprehensive division will involve both Italy and France. Germany will retain control over the German-speaking areas, Italy will claim the Italian-speaking regions, and France will annex the French-speaking areas, such as Romandy. This will ensure the Axis maintains firm control over all of Switzerland’s regions while preventing any future resistance from within the country."

With its rich resources, massive population, and strategic coastline, securing control over China could solidify Japan's status as a world power. However, the scope of our ambitions must be weighed carefully in light of the risks and rewards.\n\nWe are faced with two potential paths:\n\n§RModerate Claim§!:\nThis approach focuses on securing the Chinese coastline, from Manchuria down to Guangzhou. This would grant Japan control over critical ports, trade routes, and a large portion of China's industrial base, ensuring dominance over maritime trade and access to essential resources. While this would weaken China considerably, there remains a possibility—albeit slim—that under the right conditions, China may accede to this claim to avoid total collapse. It would still leave China as a viable entity in the interior but under Japanese influence.\n\n§RMaximalist Claim§!:\nThe maximalist option envisions full control of all Chinese territory. This would allow Japan to dominate the entire region, exploiting the vast resources and manpower of the Chinese mainland. However, such a claim is far more aggressive and would likely provoke fierce resistance from the Chinese government and population, as well as international powers. While this approach offers the greatest potential rewards, the possibility of China surrendering to such a demand is extremely unlikely, requiring either complete military collapse or unprecedented internal strife within China for it to become a reality."

These territories would significantly strengthen Japan's northern position and grant broader access to Siberia's resource wealth.\n\n§RMaximalist Claim§!:\nThe most far-reaching option seeks to dominate most of Siberia, incorporating Mongolia, Tannu Tuva, and the remaining Siberian territories.

Each step of expansion comes with its own rewards and risks, from securing valuable resources to provoking larger conflicts. Japan must decide how far it is willing to extend its empire.\n\nWe are presented with three options:\n\n§RMinimalist Claim§!:\nThis approach focuses on securing the Allied colonial enclaves in China and India, alongside control of key strategic islands throughout the Pacific, such as Midway, Hawaii, and Samoa. While this would strengthen Japan’s position and secure maritime routes, it limits direct confrontation with major powers and keeps the expansion manageable.\n\n§RModerate Claim§!:\nIn this scenario, Japan extends its ambitions beyond the small islands and colonial enclaves to include Indochina, Malaya, the Dutch East Indies, and the Philippines. This would grant Japan control over vital resources, especially oil and rubber, and significantly weaken Western influence in Southeast Asia. However, such a move would draw the attention and opposition of the United States and Britain, leading to broader conflicts in the Pacific.\n\n§RMaximalist Claim§!:\nThe most expansive option envisions Japanese control stretching from the small islands and Southeast Asia to include Australia, New Zealand, and all of India. This would establish Japan as the dominant power across the entire Asia-Pacific region. While the rewards in terms of resources and strategic positioning are immense, the risks are equally severe. This would provoke global powers into full-scale war, stretching Japan’s military and economic resources to their limits.
