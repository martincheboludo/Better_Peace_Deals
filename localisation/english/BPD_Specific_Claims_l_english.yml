BPD_Specific_Claims_Country.1.d:0 "The region of the Horn of Africa represents a vital strategic opportunity for the growth and prosperity of the Italian Empire. Ethiopia, with its vast natural resources and prime location along critical trade routes, is a key piece in expanding our influence across East Africa. By securing Ethiopia, we will not only solidify Italy's rightful claim to the region but also enhance our access to valuable materials needed to fuel our industry and military might. This conquest will restore Italy's prestige on the global stage, asserting our dominance over lesser powers and fulfilling our vision of a new Roman Empire in Africa. The acquisition of Ethiopia will also provide us with a vital staging ground for future territorial expansions, cementing Italy's rightful place as a colonial power alongside our European counterparts."

BPD_Specific_Claims_Country.2.t:0 "German Division of Greece"
BPD_Specific_Claims_Country.2.d:0 "With Greece under Axis control, the time has come to decide the fate of its territories. As the dominant power in the Axis, Germany must determine how to divide Greece between our allies while securing our own strategic interests in the region.\n\nWe are presented with two distinct options:\n\n§RHistorical Division§!:\nFollowing historical agreements, Greece will be divided between Germany, Bulgaria, and Italy. Germany will claim a portion of Thrace, securing a foothold in the Balkans, as well as part of Crete for strategic control of the Mediterranean. Bulgaria will be awarded the remainder of Thrace, while Italy will take control of the rest of Greece, solidifying its influence in the region.\n\n§RDivide Between Bulgaria and Italy§!:\nIn this option, Germany will abstain from claiming Greek territories, allowing our allies to strengthen their hold. Bulgaria will gain control of all of Thrace, while Italy will assume control over the remainder of Greece. While Germany forfeits direct territorial gains, this division ensures stability in the Balkans and reinforces the Axis alliance, allowing Germany to focus its efforts on other fronts."

BPD_Specific_Claims_Country.3.t:0 "German Division of Yugoslavia"
BPD_Specific_Claims_Country.3.d:0 "With Yugoslavia fractured and its government in disarray, Germany has the opportunity to solidify its influence in the Balkans. As the leader of the Axis, we can dictate the division of Yugoslavia among our allies, ensuring Germany retains key strategic territories while maintaining control over the region.\n\nWe are presented with three distinct options:\n\n§RHistorical Claims Only§!:\nIn accordance with previous agreements, Yugoslavia will be divided among our Axis partners. Germany will secure Slovenia, Hungary will claim Vojvodina, Bulgaria will take control of Macedonia and Southern Serbia, while Italy will expand its influence with the acquisition of Ljubljana, Montenegro, and Kosovo. Croatia and Serbia will become puppet states, serving as vital buffers under German supervision.\n\n§RItaly Gets Dalmatia§!:\nIn this option, Italy will be granted additional territories along the Dalmatian coast, furthering their power in the Adriatic. While Germany retains Slovenia and influence over the Yugoslav heartland, this arrangement strengthens Italy’s position but ensures our interests remain secure."

BPD_Specific_Claims_Country.4.t:0 "Italian Claim on Bulgaria"
BPD_Specific_Claims_Country.4.d:0 "Bulgaria represents a key opportunity for the expansion of the Italian Empire into the Balkans. With its strategic position in Southeastern Europe, controlling Bulgaria would provide Italy with vital access to the Black Sea and key transportation routes to further our ambitions in the region. Bulgaria’s resources and manpower would strengthen our military capabilities and support our wider vision of uniting the Balkans under Italian influence. Furthermore, bringing Bulgaria under Italian control would limit the influence of both Germany and the Soviet Union, positioning Italy as the dominant power in the Balkans and reinforcing our path toward restoring the glory of the Roman Empire. This claim is essential in cementing Italy’s dominance over its Balkan neighbors and expanding our sphere of influence."

BPD_Specific_Claims_Country.5.t:0 "Italian Claim on Turkey"
BPD_Specific_Claims_Country.5.d:0 "Turkey occupies a critical geopolitical position, bridging Europe and Asia, and controlling access to the Mediterranean and the Middle East. Securing control over Turkey would allow the Italian Empire to dominate the Bosporus and Dardanelles, crucial choke points for trade and military operations. Turkey's natural resources, combined with its strategic location, would bolster Italy’s economic and military strength, enabling us to project power deep into the Eastern Mediterranean and beyond. By asserting our claim on Turkey, Italy will not only limit the influence of rival powers such as the Soviet Union and Britain but also gain a powerful foothold in a region of immense historical and strategic significance. The conquest of Turkey would reaffirm Italy's imperial ambitions and mark a crucial step toward the revival of the Roman Empire."

BPD_Specific_Claims_Country.6.d:0 "Greece is a nation of immense historical significance, and its strategic position in the Eastern Mediterranean makes it an invaluable target for the Italian Empire. By asserting our claim over Greece, Italy would secure vital ports and control key trade routes, enhancing our dominance over the Mediterranean. Furthermore, Greece’s natural resources and manpower would contribute to Italy’s war effort and economic expansion, ensuring our position as a formidable power in the region. Bringing Greece into the fold of the Italian Empire would be a major step in restoring the prestige and legacy of Rome, asserting Italian supremacy over the ancient lands of Hellas."

BPD_Specific_Claims_Country.7.d:0 "Yugoslavia represents both a strategic and symbolic opportunity for Italy’s expansion in the Balkans. Dominating Yugoslavia would grant Italy unparalleled influence in the region, securing vital territories that would provide a buffer against any future threats. With its abundant resources and control over important transportation routes, Yugoslavia is a key piece in our plan to extend Italian hegemony over the Balkans. By asserting our claim on Yugoslavia, Italy will limit the influence of other regional powers while consolidating our position as the dominant force in Southeastern Europe. This is a crucial step toward the revival of the Roman Empire and Italy’s rightful place as a European power."

BPD_Specific_Claims_Country.8.d:0 "The time has come for Italy to assert its rightful claims on French territory. By taking control of key regions that historically belonged to the Italian sphere, we will expand our influence and secure strategically important areas to further our dominance in Europe.\n\nWe are presented with two options:\n\n§RClaim Corsica and Savoy§!:\nIn this option, Italy will lay claim to the island of Corsica and the region of Savoy. Both territories hold immense historical and strategic significance, with Corsica offering control over Mediterranean routes and Savoy providing a buffer between Italy and France.\n\n§RClaim Previous Plus Alpes and Rhône§!:\nThis option goes further, allowing Italy to expand beyond Corsica and Savoy to claim the Alpine regions and the Rhône valley. By securing these additional territories, Italy will strengthen its control over critical mountain passes and river systems, enhancing both our defensive and economic position in Western Europe."

BPD_Specific_Claims_Country.9.d:0 "As Italy seeks to expand its influence and restore its imperial legacy, the time has come to decide on our colonial ambitions. We have the opportunity to assert control over strategic territories that will enhance our position and influence in the Mediterranean and beyond.\n\nWe are presented with three options:\n\n§RMinimalist Claims§!:\nIn this option, Italy will focus on claiming Tunisia, a key territory in North Africa with strategic and economic value. Securing Tunisia will enhance our control over the Mediterranean and provide valuable resources to fuel our empire.\n\n§RModerate Claims§!:\nBuilding on the Minimalist Claims, this option expands our reach to include Malta, Cyprus, and Egypt, in addition to Tunisia. By claiming these territories, Italy will gain control over crucial islands and the vital Nile Valley, strengthening our strategic positioning in the Mediterranean and the Red Sea, and enhancing our trade routes and military presence in the region.\n\n§RMaximalist Claims§!:\nThis most ambitious option includes all the territories from the Moderate Claims, plus the Arabian Peninsula. By asserting control over Tunisia, Malta, Cyprus, Egypt, and the Arabian Peninsula, Italy will extend its influence across a vast region, securing crucial territories in both North Africa and the Middle East. This sweeping control will significantly bolster our strategic and economic dominance, positioning Italy as a major power in the colonial world."

BPD_Specific_Claims_Country.10.d:0 "As the war progresses, the question of Northern France looms large. The strategic importance of this region is undeniable, but we must carefully consider the implications of our decisions on our post-war relations and long-term stability. It is important to note that this decision will not affect any existing cores or claims we have on France, which will be retained regardless of the choice made.\n\nWe are presented with two options:\n\n§ROccupy it indefinitely§!:\nBy choosing to occupy Northern France indefinitely, we secure continued control over a strategically vital area. This would provide us with economic and military advantages but could also lead to friction with Vichy France. Maintaining this territory may create resentment and the potential for future hostility, transforming Vichy France from a collaborative partner into a potential enemy.\n\n§RReturn it at the end of the war§!:\nOpting to return Northern France at the end of the war could foster goodwill and maintain a cooperative relationship with Vichy France. This approach would help stabilize the region and potentially prevent future conflicts. By choosing this path, we avoid the risk of creating a lasting adversary and ensure a more stable post-war environment. This decision will not alter any of our existing claims or cores on France, which will remain intact."

BPD_Specific_Claims_Country.11.d:0 "As we assess our territorial ambitions in Poland, we must decide the extent of our claims to ensure our strategic interests are met. Each option presents a different level of territorial control and influence.\n\nWe are presented with three options:\n\n§ROur 1914 Border§!:\nThis option claims the territories of Poland that were part of the German Empire before World War I. By focusing on the 1914 borders, we restore historical claims and consolidate control over key areas while maintaining a more restrained approach to territorial expansion.\n\n§RPrevious Plus Lodz and Plock§!:\nBuilding on the 1914 borders, this option includes the addition of Lodz and Plock. By claiming these additional cities, we enhance our strategic and economic position in Poland, gaining control over vital industrial and logistical centers that will further bolster our influence in the region.\n\n§RAll of Poland§!:\nThe most expansive option, this claim encompasses all of Poland. By asserting control over the entire country, we consolidate complete dominance over Polish territory, ensuring total control over its resources, infrastructure, and strategic position. This approach maximizes our territorial gains and influence but requires careful consideration of the potential political and military repercussions."
