BPD_Specific_Claims_Country.1.d:0 "The region of the Horn of Africa represents a vital strategic opportunity for the growth and prosperity of the Italian Empire. Ethiopia, with its vast natural resources and prime location along critical trade routes, is a key piece in expanding our influence across East Africa. By securing Ethiopia, we will not only solidify Italy's rightful claim to the region but also enhance our access to valuable materials needed to fuel our industry and military might. This conquest will restore Italy's prestige on the global stage, asserting our dominance over lesser powers and fulfilling our vision of a new Roman Empire in Africa.

Germany will claim a portion of Thrace, securing a foothold in the Balkans, as well as part of Crete for strategic control of the Mediterranean. Bulgaria will be awarded the remainder of Thrace, while Italy will take control of the rest of Greece, solidifying its influence in the region.\n§RDivide Between Bulgaria and Italy§!:\nIn this option, Germany will abstain from claiming Greek territories, allowing our allies to strengthen their hold. Bulgaria will gain control of all of Thrace, while Italy will assume control over the remainder of Greece. While Germany forfeits direct territorial gains, this division ensures stability in the Balkans and reinforces the Axis alliance, allowing Germany to focus its efforts on other fronts."

Germany will secure Slovenia, Hungary will claim Vojvodina, Bulgaria will take control of Macedonia and Southern Serbia, while Italy will expand its influence with the acquisition of Ljubljana, Montenegro, and Kosovo. Croatia and Serbia will become puppet states, serving as vital buffers under German supervision.\n§RItaly Gets Dalmatia§!:\nIn this option, Italy will be granted additional territories along the Dalmatian coast, furthering their power in the Adriatic.

Bulgaria’s resources and manpower would strengthen our military capabilities and support our wider vision of uniting the Balkans under Italian influence. Furthermore, bringing Bulgaria under Italian control would limit the influence of both Germany and the Soviet Union, positioning Italy as the dominant power in the Balkans and reinforcing our path toward restoring the glory of the Roman Empire.

Turkey's natural resources, combined with its strategic location, would bolster Italy’s economic and military strength, enabling us to project power deep into the Eastern Mediterranean and beyond. By asserting our claim on Turkey, Italy will not only limit the influence of rival powers such as the Soviet Union and Britain but also gain a powerful foothold in a region of immense historical and strategic significance.

With its abundant resources and control over important transportation routes, Yugoslavia is a key piece in our plan to extend Italian hegemony over the Balkans. By asserting our claim on Yugoslavia, Italy will limit the influence of other regional powers while consolidating our position as the dominant force in Southeastern Europe.

Securing Tunisia will enhance our control over the Mediterranean and provide valuable resources to fuel our empire.\n§RModerate Claims§!:\nBuilding on the Minimalist Claims, this option expands our reach to include Malta, Cyprus, and Egypt, in addition to Tunisia. By claiming these territories, Italy will gain control over crucial islands and the vital Nile Valley, strengthening our strategic positioning in the Mediterranean and the Red Sea, and enhancing our trade routes and military presence in the region.\n§RMaximalist Claims§!:\nThis most ambitious option includes all the territories from the Moderate Claims, plus the Arabian Peninsula. By asserting control over Tunisia, Malta, Cyprus, Egypt, and the Arabian Peninsula, Italy will extend its influence across a vast region, securing crucial territories in both North Africa and the Middle East.

It is important to note that this decision will not affect any existing cores or claims we have on France, which will be retained regardless of the choice made.\nWe are presented with two options:\n§ROccupy it indefinitely§!:\nBy choosing to occupy Northern France indefinitely, we secure continued control over a strategically vital area. This would provide us with economic and military advantages but could also lead to friction with Vichy France. Maintaining this territory may create resentment and the potential for future hostility, transforming Vichy France from a collaborative partner into a potential enemy.\n§RReturn it at the end of the war§!:\nOpting to return Northern France at the end of the war could foster goodwill and maintain a cooperative relationship with Vichy France. This approach would help stabilize the region and potentially prevent future conflicts. By choosing this path, we avoid the risk of creating a lasting adversary and ensure a more stable post-war environment.

By focusing on the 1914 borders, we restore historical claims and consolidate control over key areas while maintaining a more restrained approach to territorial expansion.\n§RModerate Claim (Previous Plus Lodz and Plock)§!:\nBuilding on the 1914 borders, this option includes the addition of Lodz and Plock. By claiming these additional cities, we enhance our strategic and economic position in Poland, gaining control over vital industrial and logistical centers that will further bolster our influence in the region.\n§RMaximalist Claim (All of Poland)§!:\nThe most expansive option, this claim encompasses all of Poland. By asserting control over the entire country, we consolidate complete dominance over Polish territory, ensuring total control over its resources, infrastructure, and strategic position.

By restoring control over Alsace, we reinforce our western defenses and regain a key part of our national heritage without overcommitting our resources.\n§RModerate Claim (Alsace and Nord Pas-de-Calais)§!:\nBuilding on the claim to Alsace, this option extends German control to include Nord Pas-de-Calais, a region vital for its industrial strength and strategic position near the English Channel. Securing both Alsace and Nord Pas-de-Calais strengthens our position in Western Europe and enhances our economic and military capabilities.\n§RMaximalist Claim (Previous Plus Eastern France)§!:\nThe most expansive claim seeks to extend our control to the historical borders of the Holy Roman Empire, encompassing Eastern France. By pushing the border to include all territories that once lay within the HRE, we cement Germany's dominance in the region and reclaim historical lands.

By doing so, we aim to maintain Germany's current borders and avoid prolonged conflict or resistance from local populations, securing peace and stability while achieving our immediate war goals.\n§RModerate Claim§!:\nIn this option, we aim to annex regions with significant German-speaking populations, including Austria, Sudetenland, Alsace-Lorraine, and Bohemia. This ensures the unity of German-speaking peoples under the Reich while maintaining a balanced expansion without overextending our resources.\n§RMaximalist Claim§!:\nExpanding further, this option includes annexing the Benelux countries (Belgium, the Netherlands, and Luxembourg), in addition to Czechia and the German-speaking areas. This gives us control over key European trade routes and strategic positions, strengthening Germany’s influence in Central and Western Europe.\n§RExtreme Claim§!:\nThe most ambitious option seeks to extend German control to include Norway and Denmark, alongside the Benelux, Czechia, and all German-speaking regions.

Reclaiming these colonies would bolster our economy with access to valuable resources and markets while reasserting Germany’s rightful place as a colonial power.\n§RPrevious Plus Mittelafrika§!:\nThe most ambitious plan would see Germany not only reclaim its lost colonies but also expand its control over the concept of Mittelafrika—a vast colonial empire in central Africa.

However, the scope of our ambitions must be weighed carefully in light of the risks and rewards.\nWe are faced with two potential paths:\n§RModerate Claim§!:\nThis approach focuses on securing the Chinese coastline, from Manchuria down to Guangzhou. This would grant Japan control over critical ports, trade routes, and a large portion of China's industrial base, ensuring dominance over maritime trade and access to essential resources. While this would weaken China considerably, there remains a possibility—albeit slim—that under the right conditions, China may accede to this claim to avoid total collapse. It would still leave China as a viable entity in the interior but under Japanese influence.\n§RMaximalist Claim§!:\nThe maximalist option envisions full control of all Chinese territory. This would allow Japan to dominate the entire region, exploiting the vast resources and manpower of the Chinese mainland. However, such a claim is far more aggressive and would likely provoke fierce resistance from the Chinese government and population, as well as international powers.

Japan must decide how far it is willing to extend its empire.\nWe are presented with three options:\n§RMinimalist Claim§!:\nThis approach focuses on securing the Allied colonial enclaves in China and India, alongside control of key strategic islands throughout the Pacific, such as Midway, Hawaii, and Samoa. While this would strengthen Japan’s position and secure maritime routes, it limits direct confrontation with major powers and keeps the expansion manageable.\n§RModerate Claim§!:\nIn this scenario, Japan extends its ambitions beyond the small islands and colonial enclaves to include Indochina, Malaya, the Dutch East Indies, and the Philippines. This would grant Japan control over vital resources, especially oil and rubber, and significantly weaken Western influence in Southeast Asia. However, such a move would draw the attention and opposition of the United States and Britain, leading to broader conflicts in the Pacific.\n§RMaximalist Claim§!:\nThe most expansive option envisions Japanese control stretching from the small islands and Southeast Asia to include Australia, New Zealand, and all of India.

While this claim aims to restore national pride and integrity, it also allows for the possibility of negotiation and coexistence, avoiding direct confrontation with Japan’s military might.\n§RModerate Claim§!\nThis claim builds upon the Minimalist approach by including the return of Korea. This expanded demand aims not only to reclaim lost Chinese lands but also to reinforce historical ties with Korea, further weakening Japanese influence in the region. However, it risks escalating tensions significantly, drawing the ire of the Japanese military.\n§RMaximalist Claim§!\nThe Maximalist approach seeks not only the return of Korea but also additional strategic territories, including South Sakhalin, the Kuril Islands, and Okinawa. These regions hold significant strategic value and would further cripple Japan’s ability to project power in Asia, though this would likely escalate the conflict to unprecedented levels.\n§RExtreme Claim§!\nThe most aggressive option demands not only all previously mentioned territories but also the total annexation of Japan itself.

These claims challenge the balance of power in East Asia and Siberia, forcing China to weigh its goals against the threat of a larger conflict with Russia.\nWe are presented with two options:\n§RModerate Claim§!\nThis approach focuses on reclaiming Outer Manchuria and North Sakhalin, regions historically linked to China but currently under Russian control. These territories are critical for China's strategic expansion in Northeast Asia and would help secure access to valuable resources. However, asserting such claims could strain relations with Russia and might provoke military resistance.\n§RMaximalist Claim§!\nThe Maximalist approach includes all territories in the Moderate claim, but also demands the incorporation of Mongolia and Tanu Tuva into Chinese control. These areas hold deep historical significance and would greatly expand China's influence in Central and East Asia. However, this ambitious move would likely lead to a full-scale conflict with Russia, as the geopolitical stakes rise dramatically."

BPD_Specific_Claims_Country.26.t:0 "Soviet Claim on Poland"
BPD_Specific_Claims_Country.26.d:0 "As tensions rise in Eastern Europe, the Soviet Union must reassess its position and consider reclaiming territories historically tied to its national identity. With Poland's shifting borders and the presence of ethnic Russians, Ukrainians, and Belarusians in these regions, the Soviet leadership faces critical decisions that could reshape the balance of power in the region.\nWe are presented with two options:\n§RClaim Bielorussian and Ukrainian Territory§!\nThis claim seeks the integration of territories with significant Belarusian and Ukrainian populations into the Soviet Union. By restoring these lands, the USSR aims to strengthen its influence in Eastern Europe, promote the welfare of these ethnic groups, and solidify its borders against potential threats from the West. However, this aggressive stance may provoke backlash from Poland and its allies.\n§RPrevious Minus Bialystok§!\nThis option modifies the first claim by excluding Bialystok, a city of strategic importance that might complicate relations with Poland. By focusing on less contentious territories, the Soviet Union can still enhance its influence while reducing the likelihood of immediate conflict. This more cautious approach might also open avenues for negotiation with Poland."

BPD_Specific_Claims_Country.27.t:0 "Soviet Claim on Finland"
BPD_Specific_Claims_Country.27.d:0 "As the geopolitical landscape in Northern Europe evolves, the Soviet Union recognizes the need to address its territorial ambitions regarding Finland. The legacy of past conflicts and the presence of ethnic Russians in the region compel Soviet leadership to consider a range of claims. Each option carries distinct implications for both Soviet security and relations with Finland.\nWe are presented with three options:\n§RMinimalist Claim:§!\nThis approach focuses on the reclamation of Salla and Karelia, regions historically linked to Russia. These areas are seen as vital for security and cultural heritage. While this claim seeks to restore national pride, it also risks aggravating Finland and potentially drawing the ire of Western powers.\n§RModerate Claim:§!\nBuilding upon the Minimalist claim, this option includes the acquisition of Petsamo, a strategically important territory that provides access to the Arctic Sea. This expanded claim not only strengthens the Soviet position but also enhances control over critical resources. However, the risk of escalating tensions with Finland remains significant.\n§RMaximalist Claim:§!\nThe most ambitious option extends the claim to include the Aland Islands, which are strategically located in the Baltic Sea. This claim reflects a vision of comprehensive Soviet dominance in the region. While the rewards in terms of security and influence are considerable, the risks of provoking a larger conflict with Finland and its allies are substantial."

BPD_Specific_Claims_Country.28.t:0 "Soviet Claim on The Axis"
BPD_Specific_Claims_Country.28.d:0 "In light of the Axis powers' expansion across Eastern Europe, the Soviet Union faces a critical juncture. Historical injustices and territorial losses compel Soviet leadership to reassess its claims against these aggressive nations. The reclamation of these territories is seen not only as a matter of national pride but also as essential for ensuring security and stability in the region.\nWe are presented with the option to assert our historical claims:\n§RHistorical Claims§!\nThis comprehensive claim encompasses Kaliningrad, Memel, Carpathian Ruthenia, lands annexed from Romania, Belarusian and Ukrainian territories, and the Baltic states. By reclaiming these areas, the Soviet Union aims to restore its pre-World War I borders and strengthen its influence in Eastern Europe. This assertive stance could galvanize support among local populations and secure vital resources, but it risks provoking a strong response from the Axis powers, potentially leading to broader conflict."

BPD_Specific_Claims_Country.29.t:0 "Soviet Claim on Japan"
BPD_Specific_Claims_Country.29.d:0 "As tensions in the Pacific escalate, the Soviet Union must confront the question of its territorial ambitions regarding Japan. Historical grievances and strategic considerations compel Soviet leadership to evaluate claims over key territories in the region. Each option presents unique opportunities and risks that could shape the future balance of power in Asia.\nWe are presented with three options:\n§RMinimalist Claim:§!\nThis approach seeks the reclamation of South Sakhalin and the Kuril Islands. These territories, previously held by Russia, are vital for maintaining a secure northern border and enhancing access to the Pacific. While this claim restores a measure of national pride, it also allows for potential negotiation with Japan to avoid direct confrontation.\n§RModerate Claim:§!\nBuilding on the Minimalist Claim, this option includes Manchuria and grants Mongolia control over Mengkuko, further solidifying Soviet influence in the region. Manchuria holds significant historical and strategic importance, providing crucial resources and serving as a buffer against Japanese expansion. The inclusion of Mengkuko enhances Soviet-Mongolian ties and weakens Japanese control. However, this claim significantly raises tensions with Japan and risks provoking a military response.\n§RMaximalist Claim:§!\nThe most ambitious claim seeks to extend Soviet control to include Korea. This claim reflects a vision of Soviet dominance in East Asia, aiming to eliminate Japanese influence and secure strategic resources. While the potential rewards are immense, the risks of provoking a full-scale conflict with Japan are substantial, potentially stretching Soviet resources and resolve to their limits."
