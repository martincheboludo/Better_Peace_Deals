 BPD_Better_Peace_Deals_Country.1.d:0 "We have just received a telegram from the [FROM.GetAdjective] government proposing an immediate return to the status quo ante bellum. Despite the hardships of the conflict, [FROM.GetLeader] suggests that both sides restore their pre-war borders and cease hostilities. This offer is likely an acknowledgment that neither side has gained a decisive advantage, and [FROM.GetName] seeks to avoid further unnecessary loss of life. Accepting this proposal would mean an end to the war with no territorial changes, returning our nation to its pre-war state. The question now lies with us; do we accept this offer of peace or continue the fight?"

The [FROM.GetAdjective] leadership argues that they have already achieved their primary objectives and wish to avoid further bloodshed.

This would mean that [FROM.GetName] retains any gains made during the conflict, while [ROOT.GetName] would be left with the losses sustained thus far. [FROM.GetLeader] argues that further conflict will only lead to unnecessary devastation, and that peace based on the present borders would benefit both nations. However, agreeing to these terms would mean accepting defeat on the battlefield and formalizing the enemy's gains. Do we agree to peace at the current frontiers, or reject this offer and continue the fight?"
